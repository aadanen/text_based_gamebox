# text_based_gamebox
A bunch of text based games in cpp which can be played in the terminal

Right now making basics like Hangman and tictactoe. Would eventually like to add an adventure game or maybe something like interactive fiction.

I'm just out here learning c++ so if anyone sees this feel free to read what I did and give me some feedback!
