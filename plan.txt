# Lets try really getting a good idea of the project from the start!

# Current todo

__ FINISH HANGMAN __
* input validation for guesses and for keyword
* dont use magic number of 5, make a private int that is set during init

__ MAKE THE GAMEBOX CLASS TUI __

# All of the games should inherit a "game" interface that recquires them to have a play method
# Should also recquire them to have like a get_title method
# That way we can have the game box have like Game g = (user_input) and then g.play() 
^ Dependency injection? ^

# I wonder if theres a better way to list out the classes then by explicitly constructing each one before puttin them in a list

# I wonder if theres a better way than the get_title method. If it just returns shouldn't I be able to have a public constant?
# public static constant?
