# Lets try really getting a good idea of the project from the start!

# Current todo
* follow the plan for main (important)
* input validation for guesses and for keyword
* implement MAX_CHANCES

# main
depends on hangman.h and hangman.cpp
gets the keyword from the user
makes a hangman game and starts it
returns 0 when control flows back to it

# hangman
need a hangman.h and hangman.cpp
has init(std::string keyword, int max_chances)
init also frees the char* and reinitilizes it, setting int incorrect_guesses to 0
init also (re)sets the underscore string to "_" repeated keyword.length() times
has a char* of incorrectly guessed letters, and a std::string "_____"
the "_" get replaced with letters if they match the keyword in that position
can display its state: prints out each incorrect letter

if the players guesses end up replacing all the underscores then the guesser won
if the num guesses > max_chances then the hangman won

# MAKE A STRING MANIPULATOR CLASS
repeat some char a number of times in a string
find positions of all matches to an input
